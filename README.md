# Game Journal App - Assignment for HTTP 5226

This is the concept for a Passion Project Assignment.

Game Journal was born of an idea. Going through Instagram I found an account of a person that created a physical journal to add small entries with drawings and notes about the games they are currently playing. I honestly wanted to do this in the same way but also thought to myself: “Would this be possible as a digital app/website?”.

## Current Features:
- A list showcasing the games a potential user could be playing.
- A list of Entries.
- A list of Users.

## Features to-be-added:
- A list on the Journal Entry part to select the games and users on the system.
- A more secure way for logged users to access this if it were to be deployed.

## Comments:

Currently, due to time constrains and unknown errors the features on the to-be-added list have not been implemented. The App had to be reverted to it's initial iteration and it'll be worked in the future.
